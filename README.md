A simple project focused on RNG(and animations).

~ Original project revisioned, new task established. ~

w/o summary for now

18.09.2016:
  Coded some animation, managed to do a domino like effect but the overall flow
  is not as fluid as it's needs to be.
19.09.2016:
  Integrated Velocity.js, animations are smooth now. Encountered a problem with
  rerolling/rerunning though, that's why button will be disabled after the first roll
  and the page needs to be reloaded in order to run the script again.
